a simple prototype of possible dynamic header interactions for e-commerce sites

From my time working with a number of e-commerce sites the main branding element is usually a large static hero image or dynamic carousel. This was a quick mock up of the possibilities of a sticky header whose images changed based on where in the selling page the user was currently scrolled, ie a 'New Arrivals' banner would fade in when a user scrolled to the new arrivals section etc.
